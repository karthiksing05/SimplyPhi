General Todo: (DO ALL THIS TMRW!)
- program a regression experiment from scratch that uses the bins to the advantage, test with that
- if need be, revisit the classification thing and see if you can identify why the backward TPM
  couldn't be calculated properly
- Continue working on the research paper! Finish Question + Hypotheses and Psychology Background!

At some point in the future too: interpret the findings from phiTrendsTest4.py!

Also, understand the best practices to reduce a neural network apart from raw experimental
calculations (that's the main optimization we can make rn)

IN THE VERY DISTANT FUTURE:

And honestly...we're coming up around the time when thinking of Phi optimizations / simplifications
is becoming more and more warranted--devote majority of brain cells to this now!
- quick note: you should simplify the test to biggest subsystem --> largest possible subsystem will
  in most cases produce the best phi!

ANOTHER NOTE: think about how to value smaller subsystems. Obviously the values of phi will not be
as big, but by calculating the theoretical maximums for phi for each subset state, we can identify
the most relatively conscious parts.
- along with this, focus on how

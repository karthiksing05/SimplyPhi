General Todo:
- AT SOME POINT: migrate everything to 4.0 and rerun the tests (compare phi-structures!)
- todo list for optimWithPhiTest.py 
    - add binaryOptim.py realizations
    - add phi as derivative for first little bit

AT GHP:
- run phiTrendsTest3.py with more epochs (5-10) on one of their machines?

And honestly...we're coming up around the time when thinking of Phi optimizations / simplifications
is becoming more and more warranted--devote majority of brain cells to this now!
- quick note: you should simplify the test to biggest subsystem --> largest possible subsystem will in most cases produce the best phi!

ANOTHER NOTE: think about how to optimize

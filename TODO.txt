BRAIN WAVE BRAIN WAVE BRAIN WAVE: Create a generative loss function that utilizes phi as its metric
for optimization?? ngl I don't even understand what this means but I'm such a fan XDD

NOPE EVEN BETTER IN ADDITION TO THIS - OPTIMIZE THE BACKPROPAGATION USING THE SIA YUM YUM YUM YOU SO 
SMART GANGGANG WOOWOOWOW

IN THE VERY DISTANT FUTURE:
Understand the best practices to reduce a neural network apart from raw experimental
calculations (that's the main optimization we can make rn)
- based on the test we just did, can reduce neural network through two layers which is hella funny
  but also could work well

And honestly...we're coming up around the time when thinking of Phi optimizations / simplifications
is becoming more and more warranted--devote majority of brain cells to this now!
- quick note: you should simplify the test to biggest subsystem --> largest possible subsystem will
  in most cases produce the best phi!

ANOTHER NOTE: think about how to value smaller subsystems. Obviously the values of phi will not be
as big, but by calculating the theoretical maximums for phi for each subset state, we can identify
the most relatively conscious parts.

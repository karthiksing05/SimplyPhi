General Todo: (DO ALL THIS TMRW!)
- Finish Question + Hypotheses and Psychology Background!
- Thoroughly document (in a google doc or smth) the primary pivots made
- finish the categorical variable code (build the universal model!)
- generalize the layer analysis code too!
- At some point in the future too: interpret all the findings!
    - analyze phiTrendsTest4 for correlation
    - analyze regressionTest for overfitting relationship

- the backward TPM couldn't be properly calculated because of the "weirdness" of the 0s and 1s
  probabilities - > can confirm that this is the main problem, didn't work with a randomly
  generated TPM either

OKOK this is the strategy: (need to document this at some point)
- create an intermediary layer of neurons and then just use those as activations for the output
  fire b\c this is essentially instead of us doing the binning, the NN is taking care of it
  for us (we can also technically do this for the input, this is that whole "only interpret the
  middle" idea that I had at the beginning which is really sick!)
  - we can create a separate experiment to figure out whether using this as a technique for
    reducing complexity is valuable to analysis with IIT! (AFTER the one-size-fits-all)
  - the only drawback I see rn is that directly modifying a hidden layer is kinda weird but
    definitely probably possible!
  - RQ: this works because we're only concerned with causality, not interpretable accuracy.
    So if the neural network makes conscious decisions, even if we don't understand those
    decisions, it'll still reflect powerfully in the IIT analysis when we look at relationships btw
    phis and phi-structures

IN THE VERY DISTANT FUTURE:

Understand the best practices to reduce a neural network apart from raw experimental
calculations (that's the main optimization we can make rn)
- based on the test we just did, can reduce neural network through two layers which is hella funny
  but also could work well

And honestly...we're coming up around the time when thinking of Phi optimizations / simplifications
is becoming more and more warranted--devote majority of brain cells to this now!
- quick note: you should simplify the test to biggest subsystem --> largest possible subsystem will
  in most cases produce the best phi!

ANOTHER NOTE: think about how to value smaller subsystems. Obviously the values of phi will not be
as big, but by calculating the theoretical maximums for phi for each subset state, we can identify
the most relatively conscious parts.

- similar results to the other stuff!
- dude the phi as magnitude and loss as direction is working out SWIMMINGLY
- need to confirm weighted average stuff for next steps but overall, looking really really good!

NEED TO WRITE A REPORT:
- test and run the weighted average
- showcase the directional change with SIA values across MULTIPLE DATASETS
- write a report that properly analyzes the code to confirm the directional change!
